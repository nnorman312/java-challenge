JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

I write code that creates a webpage table based on a UFO dataset. Within this code, I allow users to filter the table data for specific values. This code uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

UFO Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

For level 1, I complete the following tasks: 
- Create a basic HTML web page (index.html)

- Using the UFO dataset (data.js) in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting

- Include columns for date, city, state, country, shape, and comments

For level 2, I complete the following tasks:
